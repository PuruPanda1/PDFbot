separator, flash tank and back to condenser.  The condensate pol-ishers can now be placed in service. 
3. When the feedwater total iron concentration drops below 1 ppm, sil-
ica is less than 100 ppb, and cation conductivity is less than 1 
PS/cm (c), unit firing can commence.  Boiler and start-up system 
operation should be as per instruction manual. 
a. Permissible value depends on polisher perfor-
mance/constraints. 
b. Feedwater pH > 9. c. Parameters measured at economizer inlet.
