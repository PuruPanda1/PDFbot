Steam Blowing 
Since all steam generated during the steam blowing operation is re-
leased to the atmosphere, substantial quantities of make-up demineral-
ized water are required.  A sufficient supply of this water and all other 
necessary treatment chemicals (i.e. ammonia) should be readily availa-ble.   
During each of the steam blows, the feedwater pH should be adjusted 
with ammonia as for normal operation (pH 9.2-9.6). The cation conduc-
